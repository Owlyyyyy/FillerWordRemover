# Project Title

Automatic Word Filler Remover App using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Summary

The project aims to develop an AI-powered application that automatically detects and removes word fillers (such as "um," "uh," etc.) from spoken language. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and training data from datasets like The Buckeye Speech Corpus, the app enhances the clarity and fluency of spoken communication.

## Background

Word fillers in spoken language can impact communication by reducing clarity and fluency. This app addresses the need for a tool that automatically identifies and removes these fillers, enhancing the overall quality of spoken content.

* Problems:
  * Reduced clarity and fluency in spoken communication.
  * Manual efforts in editing spoken content.
  * Lack of automated tools for filler removal.

## How is it used?

Users, such as content creators or individuals involved in public speaking, upload spoken content to the app. The CNN model, trained on datasets like The Buckeye Speech Corpus, automatically detects and removes word fillers, providing users with a more polished and fluent version of their content.

## Data sources and AI methods

Training data is sourced from datasets like The Buckeye Speech Corpus, containing natural spoken language with word fillers. The CNN model is trained on this data to learn patterns and features associated with word fillers in spoken language.

## Challenges

The app may face challenges in accurately identifying word fillers, as context and speaker variations can influence the detection process. Ethical considerations include ensuring that the removal process does not alter the intended meaning of the spoken content.

## What next?

The project could evolve by incorporating user feedback for continual improvement, expanding the training dataset to handle diverse accents and languages, and integrating with speech recognition technologies. Skills needed: deep learning, natural language processing, data preprocessing.
